Description: The Bug Priority Guidelines document provides a structured framework 
for assigning priority levels to software bugs. It outlines five priority levels 
(P0 to P4) along with clear criteria for each level. This document ensures consistency 
and efficiency in bug triaging, helping teams prioritize and address issues effectively 
based on their severity, impact, and urgency.

Bug Priority Guidelines

Priority Levels:

P0 - Critical: Issues that render the system completely unusable, causing data loss, security breaches, or significant financial impact.

Criteria:

System crashes or major malfunctions.
Security vulnerabilities with high potential for exploitation.
Loss of critical functionality affecting a large portion of users.
Significant financial impact to the company or clients.
P1 - High: Severe issues that significantly impact system functionality or user experience.

Criteria:

Major functionality impairment affecting a subset of users.
Critical feature not functioning as expected.
Severe performance degradation.
Critical UI/UX issues affecting usability.
P2 - Medium: Important issues that affect system functionality or user experience but have reasonable workarounds.

Criteria:

Non-critical features not functioning as expected.
Moderate performance degradation.
Minor security vulnerabilities with limited impact.
Non-critical UI/UX issues affecting usability.
P3 - Low: Minor issues that have minimal impact on system functionality or user experience.

Criteria:

Cosmetic issues that don't affect functionality or usability.
Minor performance issues that have negligible impact on user experience.
Documentation errors or typos.
Low priority enhancements or feature requests.
P4 - Trivial: Minor issues or enhancements that have little to no impact on system functionality or user experience.

Criteria:

Suggestions for minor improvements.
Issues with negligible impact on functionality or user experience.
Low-priority feature requests or enhancements.


Note: Assign priorities based on the combination of severity, impact, and urgency. Always prioritize critical bugs over less severe ones.
